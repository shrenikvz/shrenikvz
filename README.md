### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Shrenik Zinage!

- I am currently a PhD student in the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University advised by Prof. Ilias Bilionis.
- I hold an undergraduate degree in Ocean Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India.
- My research background lies in scientific machine learning, uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, causal AI, neuro-causality, digital twins, statistics, stochastic modeling, control, reinforcement learning and robotics.
- I am especially interested in how mathematics and machine learning can work together to solve real-world problems.
