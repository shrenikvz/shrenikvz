### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently a PhD student in the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University.
- I hold an undergraduate degree in Ocean Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India.
- My core interests lie in uncertainty quantification, scientific machine learning and stochastic control.
- Prior to joining Purdue university, I worked with Dr. Abhilash Somayajula at IITM on comprehensive comparative study of various control methodologies, ranging from classical based controllers to AI based controllers, with a specific application in active heave compensation.
